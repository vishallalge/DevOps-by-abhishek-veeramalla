Notes about all that I have learned...

## 1) What is DevOps?
- It has a culture that improves the organizational ability to deliver the application.

## 2) Is DevOps is only about delivery?
- DevOps is a process of improving your delivery, that mean making our delivery quick by ensuring that there is a proper automation.
- You have ensured that the quality is in place.
- You have ensured that set up proper monitoring and ensured that you have a continuous testing.
- DevOps :-
    - Automation
    - Quality
    - Continuous Monitoring
    - Continuous Testing

## 3) Why DevOps?
- DevOps combines development and operations to increase the efficiency, speed and security of software development and delivery compared to traditional process.

## 4) Software Development Life Cycle(SDLC) :-
- SDLC is a process that is followed by the industry to design, develop and test the high quality product.
- Produce high quality product :-
    - Design
    - Develop
    - Test
- Standerd of SDLC :-
    - Planning -> understand the requirement of the customers.
    - Defining -> documenting the things that we want
    - Designing -> focus on high level design (HLD) and low level design (LLD).
    - Building -> development(coding) -> use central repository to store code (git).
    - Testing -> identify bugs -> quality assurance team.
    - Deploy -> push on a production server -> customer
above 6 stages are the standards of the SDLC.

- As an DEVOPS engineer out main moto is that fastens this process (building, testing and deployment).

- DEVOPS engineer would automate the process.
- In this automate process we are focusing on building, testing and deployment process.


## 5) Virtual Machine :-
-   What is Virtual Machine?
    - It is a compute resource that uses software
        insted of a physical computer to run program and deploy apps.
    - One or more Virtual "guest" machines run on a physical "host" machine.
    - each VM runs its own operating system and function separately from the other VM's.

- What does Hypervisor do?
    - Hypervisor is a software that you can use to run multiple virtual machines on a single physical machine.
    - Every VM has its own operating system and application.
    - The Hypervisor allocates the underlying physical computing resource such as CPU and memory to individual VM as required.
